# Movie-Tracker-Frontend

This is a personal app created to help keep track of movies that I've watched.

I'm planning on adding more features and UI designs as I continue to work on this project.

## Description

This is the React (front end) portion of a MERN app that I'm creating.  The backend section can be found on the Movie-Tracker-Backend repo found here: 
https://github.com/JadwinL12/Movie-Tracker-Backend

### Instructions

To properly get the app to work, you should clone the backend code to get the server running first, as this app makes an API call to the server to get the list of movies.

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Run:
```
npm start
```
